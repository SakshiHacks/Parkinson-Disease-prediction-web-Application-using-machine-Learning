## Parkinson-Disease-prediction-web-Application-using-machine-Learning
Overview :
This project leverages machine learning to predict Parkinson's Disease using vocal characteristics. By analyzing features such as jitter, shimmer, and harmonic-to-noise ratio (HNR), the model provides a non-invasive, cost-effective diagnostic solution. A user-friendly web application allows individuals to upload voice samples and receive predictions in real-time.


Features :
Non-invasive prediction of Parkinsonâ€™s Disease based on vocal characteristics.
Machine learning models like Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for high accuracy.
Feature importance analysis to highlight key vocal indicators.
Web-based application for easy access and usability.
Scalable architecture for deployment on cloud platforms.


Technologies Used
Frontend:
React.js: For building an interactive and dynamic user interface.
CSS/Bootstrap/Tailwind: For responsive and aesthetic design.
Axios: For API communication between frontend and backend.

Backend:
Flask/Django: To manage APIs and integrate the machine learning model.
Python: For implementing the ML model and backend logic.

Machine Learning:
Random Forest, SVM, and Gradient Boosting: Used to train and predict from the dataset.
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, SHAP.

Deployment:
Cloud Platforms: AWS, Heroku, or Azure for hosting the web application.
Docker: For containerizing the application.
